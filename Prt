Managing Data Tables and Saptial data Sets:
a) Table joins
➢ Start a new project
➢ Go to Layer → Add Layer → Add new Vector Layer “I:\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\A\Data\tl_2013_06_tract.zip”
➢ We could import this csv file without any further action and it would be imported. But, the default type of each column would be a String (text). That is ok except for the D001 field which contains numbers for the population. Having those imported as text would not allow us to run any mathematical operations on this column. To tell QGIS to import the field as a number, we need to create a sidecar file with a .csvt extension.
➢ This file will have only 1 row specifying data types for each column. Save this file as ca_tracts_pop.csvt in the same directory as the original .csv file.
➢ Go to Layer → Add Layer → Add Delimited Text Layer And add I:\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\A\Data\ca_tacts_pop.csv”
➢ In the layer panel, Right click on “tl_2013_06_tract”, layer and select Properties
➢ Select the join option in Properties, and click on button(+) to add new table join.
➢ In the Add Vector Join window set the following properties and click OK.
➢ After performing join
➢ For more clear output, select “tl_2013_06_tact” from Layer Panel, right click and select properties. Go to Symbology and set the following properties.
➢ A detailed and accurate population map of California can be seen as the result. Same technique can be used to create maps based on variety of census data.
b) spatial joins
